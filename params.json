This is essential for discipline. Zeal and intensity throughout the exercises is required.\r\n\r\nIt should take you approximately an hour to complete one of the above, with the exception of the Tai Chi.\r\n\r\nAfter the Kriya, Yoga, and Tibetan Breaths lay in Savasana for 10-20 minutes so the nervous system can integrate the changes. http://www.yogajournal.com/pose/corpse-pose/\r\n\r\nConfused?
