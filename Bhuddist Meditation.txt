-Light incense. Have something to catch the ashes, so there is no fear of fire.
-Start meditation music.
-Sit in a half-lotus position, right over left leg, and right hand resting gently on top of the left, thumbs connecting. The image in the wiki illustrates this: https://i.imgur.com/WuvekpE.jpg
-Close the eyes, focusing them in front of you. You can also focus on the forehead or nose. The gaze should be soft and not intense.
-Breathing should be easy. You can focus on the breath, but try not to modify it.
-Spine should be straight, but after finding a good posture do not move.
-Exhale thoughts and frustrations.
-Use your gaze and breath to be your focal points.
-Lastly be STILL. Do not move. If your legs begin to become numb then stretch them.

Start with 30 minutes of meditation. Move up to 1 hour. Then increase as you see fit. 

Preparation should be done in a calm and meditative manner. 

Wait a few hours after eating or meditate in the morning before a meal.

Vegetarianism or Veganism is encouraged as meat is very heavy and a karmic toxin.
