I recommend a daily practice. This is essential for discipline.

It should take you approximately an hour to complete one of the above, with the exception of the Tai Chi.

After the Kriya, Yoga, and Tibetan Breaths lay in Shavanasana for 10-20 minutes so the nervous system can integrate the changes. http://www.yogajournal.com/pose/corpse-pose/
