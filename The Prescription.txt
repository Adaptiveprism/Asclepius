I recommend a daily practice. This is essential for discipline. Zeal and intensity throughout each exercise is required.

It should take you approximately an hour to complete one of the above, with the exception of the Tai Chi.

After the Kriya, Yoga, and Tibetan Breaths lay in Savasana for 10-20 minutes so the nervous system can integrate the changes. http://www.yogajournal.com/pose/corpse-pose/
